        fullDescription: 'Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is super happy with Elon Musk buying Twitter. So much so that some people have started saying that Dorsey, who resigned as Twitter CEO in November 2021 possibly due to signalling from Twitter Board, is the key person in the whole saga of Musk acquiring the social media site. And some are saying that not only he is the key person but Musk buying Twitter is a plan hatched by Jack Dorsey as a sort of revenge on the Twitter Board. Publicly, Dorsey has commented on the issue. He believes that with Musk buying the company, it is finally heading in the right direction. Both Musk and Dorsey have always been fond of one another. In fact, both have been spotted bonding on several topics in the past, especially on their similar interests in Bitcoin and possibilities for cryptocurrency. They also seem to have similar thoughts on topics like web3 and its future possibilities. Tesla CEO Musk was often seen supporting Dorsey in several instances in the past. He was one of the few who supported Dorsey when he was reportedly being pressured in 2020 to step down by Paul Singer, hedge fund manager, activist investor, and co-CEO of Elliott Management. Dorsey co-founded Twitter in 2006 and served as CEO until 2008. He later returned to the position in 2015 and stepped down, handing over his responsibilities to now CEO Parag Agrawal, last year. Since then, even though he still holds a seat on the board, he has kept himself away from commenting on anything Twitter-related. That is until Musk bought the platform, which Dorsey feels is great for the company. Musk and Dorsey have also been seen supporting one another in bad and good times. At the time when Dorsey was fighting with the board, Musk came out in support and said “Just want to say that I support @Jack as Twitter CEO. He has a good heart.” It all started back in 2020, when Elliott Management purchased $1 billion of Twitter stock and demanded major changes at the company, with the primary aim of removing Dorsey from the CEO’s position. At the time, Dorsey refused to step down as the CEO, arguing that he was a founder of Twitter and therefore should be the one who could run it.',
